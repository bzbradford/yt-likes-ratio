# YouTube Likes Ratio
Chrome extension to add a view:like ratio to YouTube video pages. It parses the view count and likes count from the page source and computes a % liked ratio. This text is then injected into the like button after the likes count. Now that the dislike count is gone and with it the like/dislike ratio, this extension calculates the percent of viewers who liked a video, giving some idea of viewer sentiment.
